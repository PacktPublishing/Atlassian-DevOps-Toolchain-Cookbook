{"welcome":"Welcome to the world of Pax, %USER%.  It's always disorienting - the locals like to say that the Celestial Winds that brought you here are an enigma.  But you will find close friends, hated enemies, and many many adventures ahead.  You may be wondering what's next now that you've landed.  You can of course check out our forums at https://www.paxroleplay.com .  Here you can find character profiles, ongoing posted RP's, and some general insanity.  You also don't have to stay alone here.  You can invite your friends! Don't forget to deposit your Sanity into the skull shaped baskets - it will do you no good here - and prepare for your new life on Pax.",	"random":"%USER% are teleported into Deep Space.||A vial of Pixie Punch appears in front of %USER%!||A horde of zombies attack!
